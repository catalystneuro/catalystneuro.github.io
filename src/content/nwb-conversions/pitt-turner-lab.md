description: "Comprehensive NWB conversion tools for the Turner lab's electrophysiology datasets from parkinsonian macaque studies. The conversion pipeline handles three distinct experimental paradigms: (1) Multi-area recordings (motor cortex, striatum, STN, GPi/GPe) during center-out reaching tasks with TDT recording systems, (2) Motor cortex single-unit recordings with antidromic cell-type identification (pyramidal tract and corticostriatal neurons) during visuomotor step-tracking with muscle stretch perturbations, and (3) Further datasets with specialized behavioral protocols. Includes custom NWB extension (ndx-turner-metadata) for lab-specific metadata, specialized interfaces for TDT recordings with filtered/raw data streams, and MATLAB-based electrophysiology data with trial-aligned analog signals (kinematics, EMG, LFP). Tools support multi-session experiments with interactive tutorials for data visualization and analysis."
