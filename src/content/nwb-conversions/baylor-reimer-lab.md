description: "Developed NWB conversion tools for the Reimer lab's two-photon imaging datasets. The conversion pipeline handles complex datasets including calcium imaging from the two-photon random access mesoscope (2P-RAM), behavioral measurements (locomotion, eye tracking), and olfactory stimuli. The tools support the standardization of large-scale imaging experiments involving tens of thousands of neurons across multiple visual cortical areas."
