description: "Developed NWB conversion tools for the Fox lab's research on Drosophila sensory systems. The pipeline standardizes high-speed video recordings, DeepLabCut output files, confocal imaging data, and intracellular electrophysiology recordings. These tools integrate stimulus traces and synchronization signals from Spike2, enabling researchers to study sensory processing across multiple modalities with precisely aligned data."
