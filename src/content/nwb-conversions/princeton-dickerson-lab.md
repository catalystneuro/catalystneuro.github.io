description: "Developed NWB conversion tools for the Dickerson lab's research on Drosophila sensory processing. The pipeline standardizes two-photon imaging data from ThorLabs microscopes, neck muscle imaging, and high-speed video recordings. These tools integrate synchronization data from ThorSync to align neural and behavioral measurements, facilitating comprehensive analysis of sensory-motor transformations."
