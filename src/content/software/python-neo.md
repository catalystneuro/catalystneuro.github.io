name: Neo
description: Neo is a package for reading electrophysiology data in Python, writing data, and manipulating them. Neo implements a hierarchical data model well adapted to intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology. We use neo as part of our data conversion pipeline, and contribute to it, ensuring it continues to efficiently read the latest modern acquisition data formats. We also collaboratively manage a library of test electrophysiology files that was started by the neo development team and is now also used by SpikeInterface and NeuroConv.
