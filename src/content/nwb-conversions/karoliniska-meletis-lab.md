description: "Developed NWB conversion tools for the Meletis lab's multi-modal datasets studying dopaminergic circuits. The conversion pipeline handles fiber photometry data recording calcium transients from DAT+ and Anxa1+ terminals in the striatum, as well as dopamine release using dLight1.3. The tools also process behavioral data from multiple tasks including Water Consumption, Open Field Tests with DeepLabCut pose estimation and VAME behavioral classification, Arrow Maze Choice Tasks, and Forelimb Reaching Tasks."
