description: "Developed NWB conversion tools for the DiCarlo lab's neuroscience datasets. The conversion pipeline processes data from Macaca mulatta (rhesus macaques), including Utah array recordings acquired using the Intan data acquisition system, behavioral data encoded in the MWorks format, and visual stimuli presented as images or video. Additionally, the pipeline incorporates an optimized spike-threshold crossing algorithm and tools for calculating peristimulus time histograms (PSTH)."
