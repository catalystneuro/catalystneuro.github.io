description: Developing NWB conversion tools for the Surmeier lab's ex-vivo brain slice experiments. The pipeline standardizes data from multiple sources including electrophysiology (ABF format), Bruker optical sensor recordings, two-photon laser scanning microscopy with electrical stimulation, behavioral videos, and optogenetic/pharmacological intervention metadata. These tools enable comprehensive analysis of neural activity in relation to various experimental manipulations and facilitate data sharing through the DANDI Archive with links to protocols.io.
