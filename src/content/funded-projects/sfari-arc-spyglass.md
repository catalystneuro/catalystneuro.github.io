A collaborative project funded by the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) to integrate neuroscience data into standardized NWB format and Spyglass database systems. The project focuses on converting complex behavioral and electrophysiology datasets from multiple experiments, enabling better data sharing and analysis across the neuroscience community. This work includes developing robust conversion pipelines that ensure compatibility with both NWB standards and Spyglass analysis frameworks.
