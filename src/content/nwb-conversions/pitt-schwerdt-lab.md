description: "Developed NWB conversion tools for Schwerdt Lab's multi-modal neurochemical and electrophysiology datasets from rhesus monkeys. The pipeline supports conversion of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) signals, extracellular electrophysiology (Neuralynx) recordings from chronic striatal implants, spike times, and behavioral task events during reward-biased eye movement tasks."
