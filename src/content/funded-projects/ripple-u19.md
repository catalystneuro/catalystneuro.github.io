Through funding from the NIH BRAIN Initiative's U19 program, we assist the Ripple U19 consortium in standardizing their neuroscience data using the NWB format. This project focuses on developing tools and workflows to convert and validate complex datasets from multiple labs studying hippocampal ripples and their role in memory consolidation.

The collaboration facilitates data sharing and analysis across the consortium's member labs, enabling more effective cross-lab studies of hippocampal ripple events and their relationship to memory processes.
