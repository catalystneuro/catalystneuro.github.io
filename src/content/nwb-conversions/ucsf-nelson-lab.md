description: "Developed NWB conversion tools for the Nelson lab's behavioral neuroscience datasets. The conversion pipeline integrates multiple data streams including TDT electrophysiology recordings, Noldus behavioral tracking data, AIM scoring, and behavioral video recordings. The tools support both interactive notebook-based workflows and scriptable conversion processes, enabling efficient standardization of complex behavioral experiments."
