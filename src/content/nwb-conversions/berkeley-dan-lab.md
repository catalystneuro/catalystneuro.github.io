description: Developed NWB conversion tools for the Dan lab's sleep-wake project. The pipeline standardizes multiple data streams including EEG, EMG, fiber photometry, optogenetic stimulation data, behavioral videos, and DeepLabCut pose estimation. These tools enable comprehensive analysis of brain activity during sleep and wakefulness, facilitating data sharing through the DANDI Archive with example visualization notebooks for exploring the data relationships across modalities. This project culminated in two Dandisets: The first (#001617) focuses on the neural dynamics of sleep-wake regulation, as recorded by fiber photometry and the second (#001711) centers on the effects of optogenetic stimulation on behavioral outcomes as captured by video and pose estimation data.
