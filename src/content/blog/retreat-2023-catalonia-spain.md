The CatalystNeuro team came together in October 2023 for our annual retreat, this time in the stunning Costa Brava region of Catalonia, Spain. Our home for the week was a magnificent 15-bedroom villa, Villa Mas Sant Jordi, nestled in a private 30-hectare estate surrounded by serene forests and cultivated fields.

### Strategic Planning and Collaboration

Our days began with productive morning sessions, starting with Ben's State of the Union address that set the tone for our strategic discussions. The villa's spacious rooms and peaceful surroundings provided the perfect setting for focused work on our ongoing projects and future initiatives.

### Exploring Girona

A highlight of our cultural experiences was exploring the historic city of Girona. We took a guided walking tour through its medieval streets and ancient walls, learning about the city's rich history that spans over two millennia. The tour included visits to the iconic Cathedral of Girona, the well-preserved Jewish Quarter, and the colorful houses along the River Onyar.

### Art and Culture

Another cultural highlight was our visit to the Salvador Dalí Museum in Figueres. The museum, housed in what was once the town's theater, is itself a work of art designed by Dalí himself. We explored the largest collection of the artist's works, from his early experiments to his most famous surrealist masterpieces.

### Team Building and Recreation

The villa's extensive grounds offered plenty of opportunities for team bonding. The soccer field became a hub of friendly competition, with impromptu matches bringing out everyone's playful spirit. These casual sporting activities provided a perfect balance to our intensive work sessions.

### Culinary Experiences

Our evenings were filled with wonderful Spanish cuisine. We enjoyed traditional paella, authentic Spanish barbecues, and tapas dinners both at the villa and at local restaurants. These shared meals became cherished moments for casual conversations and strengthening team bonds.

### Beach and Coastal Adventures

Being just 15 minutes from the golden beaches of Costa Brava, we took full advantage of the location with beach visits and coastal hikes. The Mediterranean landscape provided a stunning backdrop for our outdoor activities, and we even explored a historic coastal castle, adding an element of medieval history to our natural adventures.

Our week in Catalonia was more than just a retreat—it was a perfect blend of productive work sessions, cultural exploration, and team bonding. The combination of the villa's peaceful setting, the region's rich culture, and our focused collaborative sessions helped us align our vision and strengthen our commitment to advancing neuroscience data standards. As we returned to our respective locations around the world, we carried with us not just new strategies and plans, but also stronger connections and cherished memories of our time together in this beautiful corner of Spain.
