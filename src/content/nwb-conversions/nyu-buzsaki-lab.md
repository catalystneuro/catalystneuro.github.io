institution: "New York University"
description: "Developed NWB conversion tools for the Buzs√°ki lab's extensive neurophysiology datasets, handling terabyte-scale data including Neuroscope recordings, LFP signals, and behavioral measurements. The conversion pipeline features specialized interfaces for various data types and supports parallel processing for large-scale conversions, with datasets publicly available through DANDI."
