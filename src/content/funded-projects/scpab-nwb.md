Through funding from the Simons Collaboration on Plasticity and the Aging Brain (SCPAB), we assist researchers in standardizing their aging-related neuroscience data using the NWB format. This project facilitates data sharing and collaboration among SCPAB labs, enabling more effective cross-lab analyses of aging-related neural data, as well as utilization by the global neurophysiology community.
