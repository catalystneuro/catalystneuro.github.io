description: "Developed NWB conversion tools for the Suver lab's research on Drosophila sensorimotor integration. The pipeline standardizes behavioral data from multiple cameras, wing beat tracking from microphone or tachometer recordings, antenna position tracking via DeepLabCut, and patch clamp recordings through Nidaq. These tools enable comprehensive analysis of neural activity in relation to complex fly behaviors."
