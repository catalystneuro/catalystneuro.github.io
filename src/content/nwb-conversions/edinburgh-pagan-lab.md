description: "Developing NWB conversion tools for the Pagan lab's research on flexible decision-making in SFARI Autism Rat Models. The pipeline standardizes behavioral data from the Bcontrol system, behavioral video recordings, and future electrophysiological data from SpikeGadgets. These tools facilitate data sharing within the lab and publication on the DANDI Archive, while ensuring compatibility with Spyglass pipelines for reliable analysis."
