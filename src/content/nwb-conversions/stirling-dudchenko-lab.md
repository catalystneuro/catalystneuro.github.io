description: Adapting NWB conversion pipelines and analysis workflows for rodent navigation experiments studying head-direction signal alterations in Fmr1-/y rats as part of a Simons Foundation SFARI ARC project with the Dudchenko Lab. The dataset includes electrophysiology, spiking units, behavioral tracking, and experimental metadata from juvenile and adult rats investigating neural mechanisms underlying spatial navigation deficits associated with Fragile X Syndrome and autism spectrum disorder. The work updates Python conversion scripts to conform to Spyglass standards, NWB best practices, and DANDI Archive requirements, and ports MATLAB-based spike sorting and preprocessing pipelines to an open-source Python stack integrated with SpikeInterface, supporting Kilosort 2 and Kilosort 4. These tools enable seamless integration with the Spyglass framework and DANDI ecosystem across the Autism Rat Models Consortium and broader neuroscience community.
