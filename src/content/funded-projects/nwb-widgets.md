Supported by the Allen Institute, NWB Widgets provides a library of interactive widgets for visualizing NWB data in Jupyter notebooks. The project enables researchers to easily explore the hierarchical structure of NWB 2.0 files and visualize specific data elements through an intuitive interface. The widgets are designed to work out-of-the-box with NWB 2.0 files locally or on the DANDI Archive, and are easily extendable to support custom visualizations.
