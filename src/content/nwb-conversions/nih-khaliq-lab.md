description: Developing NWB conversion tools for the Khaliq lab's ex-vivo primate research. The pipeline standardizes patch clamp electrophysiology recordings in ABF format, calcium imaging data from Bruker systems (TIFF files), synchronization TTL pulses, and pharmacological data. These tools enable comprehensive analysis of hundreds of individual cells and facilitate data sharing through the DANDI Archive, with future plans for interactive Neurosift visualizations.
