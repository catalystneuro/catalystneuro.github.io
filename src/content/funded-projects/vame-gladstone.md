Contracted by Dr. Jorge Palop's laboratory at the Gladstone Institute, we are developing VAME (Variational Animal Motion Embedding), a deep learning framework for analyzing animal behavior. This project focuses on creating tools that enable researchers to automatically track and analyze complex behavioral patterns in laboratory animals, facilitating the study of neurological conditions and potential therapeutic interventions.
