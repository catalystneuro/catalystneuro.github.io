description: "Developed NWB conversion tools for the Kim lab's research on Drosophila visual processing. The pipeline standardizes two-photon imaging data, behavioral videos, and visual stimulus information. These tools integrate synchronization signals from MATLAB files and fluorescence traces from segmented regions of interest, facilitating analysis of neural responses to visual stimuli in relation to behavioral outputs."
