      "description": "Ben Dichter is the Founder of CatalystNeuro. He received his Ph.D. in Bioengineering from the UC Berkeley – UCSF Joint Program in Bioengineering, in Dr. Edward Chang's lab. There he used electrocorticography (ECoG) to study the neural control of speech in humans. Much of this work focused on how we control the pitch of our voice when we speak and sing. He is now a data scientist consultant for neuroscience labs, focusing on building systems for sharing of data and analyses.",
