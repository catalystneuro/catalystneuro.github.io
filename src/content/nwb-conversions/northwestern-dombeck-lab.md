description: "Developed NWB conversion tools for the Dombeck lab's fiber photometry datasets studying dopamine neuron subtypes. The conversion pipeline handles multi-modal data including GCaMP6f calcium signals, behavioral measurements, and genetic subtype information from the substantia nigra and striatum during reward and movement tasks."
