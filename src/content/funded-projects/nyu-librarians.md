Through funding from NYU Libraries, we assist NYU neuroscience labs in standardizing their data using the NWB format. This project currently supports two labs: Dr. Christine Constantinople's lab, which studies the neural circuits underlying economic decision-making, and Dr. David Schneider's lab, which investigates the neural basis of vocal learning and auditory processing.

This collaboration facilitates data sharing and reuse within the NYU research community and beyond, making valuable neuroscience datasets more accessible to researchers worldwide.
