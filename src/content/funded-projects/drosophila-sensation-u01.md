Supported by the National Institutes of Health U01 program, we assist researchers studying sensory processing in Drosophila to standardize their data using the NWB format. This project involves five labs (Cohen, Dickerson, Fox, Kim, and Suver) that use diverse experimental approaches including electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and behavioral tracking. By creating standardized data pipelines, this initiative facilitates cross-lab collaboration and integrated analysis of sensory processing in the fly nervous system.
