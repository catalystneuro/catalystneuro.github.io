description: Developing NWB conversion tools for the Hnasko lab's research on fiber photometry alongside behavioral measurements. The pipeline standardizes data from TDT systems (fiber photometry and TTL pulses), behavioral videos from AnyMaze, synchronization signals, histology images from Zeiss microscopes, and in-progress work on processed fiber photometry data and pose estimation. These tools enable comprehensive analysis of neural activity in relation to behavior and facilitate data sharing through the DANDI Archive.
