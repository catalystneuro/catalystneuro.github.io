Through NIH funding, we contribute to the development of the DANDI Archive, a platform for sharing and archiving neurophysiology data. This project is led by Satrajit Ghosh at MIT and Yaroslav Halchenko at Dartmouth College and aims to create a robust infrastructure for storing, sharing, and discovering neuroscience datasets in the NWB format.
