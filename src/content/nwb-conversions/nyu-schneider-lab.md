description: "Developed NWB conversion tools for multi-modal neuroscience data including behavioral tracking, electrophysiology recordings, optogenetic stimulation, intrinsic signal imaging, and auditory stimulation. The project includes conversion of behavioral data from .mat files, OpenEphys recordings, optogenetic stimulation parameters, intrinsic signal images, and auditory stimulation data from multiple experimental paradigms. These tools support experiments investigating how the auditory cortex integrates sound and movement information, encodes error and learning signals, and guides sensorimotor adaptation during skilled, sound-generating behaviors in mice."
