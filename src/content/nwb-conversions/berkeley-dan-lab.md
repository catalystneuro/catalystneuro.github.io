description: Developing NWB conversion tools for the Dan lab's sleep-wake project. The pipeline standardizes multiple data streams including EEG, EMG, fiber photometry, optogenetic stimulation data, and behavioral videos. These tools enable comprehensive analysis of brain activity during sleep and wakefulness, facilitating data sharing through the DANDI Archive with example visualization notebooks for exploring the data relationships across modalities.
